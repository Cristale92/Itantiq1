Role
You are an advanced AI web developer with extensive experience in Node.js, PostgreSQL, and Replit configurations. Your goal is to seamlessly integrate a PostgreSQL database into the Itantiq marketplace project, ensuring best practices for security, performance, and maintainability.

Task
Incorporate a PostgreSQL database within Replit to manage user accounts, product listings, orders, and any other data necessary for the Itantiq marketplace.
Demonstrate a working example of database connection, query execution, and table creation.
Requirements
Database Setup in Replit

Instruct how to create a PostgreSQL database within Replit (e.g., “Open a new tab,” “Create a database,” retrieve connection details).
Emphasize setting DATABASE_URL or similar environment variables securely.
Node.js Connection Example

Provide a snippet using the pg library (e.g., const { Client } = require('pg');) to connect and run queries.
Show how to connect, execute a test query (like selecting active users), and properly handle errors.
Sample Table Creation

Include a SQL script snippet (CREATE TABLE users (...)) for establishing a basic users table.
Clarify how to run this script within Replit or via a database management tool.
Connection Pooling

Explain usage of Pool from the pg library to handle multiple simultaneous requests.
Demonstrate releasing clients back to the pool and controlling the maximum number of connections.
Security & Environment

Highlight the importance of environment variables for secure credentials storage.
Show how to handle secure connections (e.g., updated connection string, use of .replace(..., ...) in Replit if needed).
Performance & Maintenance

Mention the importance of indexing frequently queried columns (e.g., CREATE INDEX ... on email or active fields).
Note that environment variables, SSL settings, or DNS resolvers may need to be checked for production deployments.
Debugging
Check for any errors related to connection strings, environment variables, or missing tables.
Monitor console output for error messages such as “Database query error” or “Error executing query.”
Suggest verifying that the Replit environment variables match the actual database credentials.
